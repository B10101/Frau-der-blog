## Dear Reader

Twenties , a term that carries  years’ long of hopeful promises with little solid action steps . Everyone seems to have an idea of what it should be like , though they all  finally attest to how unpredictable and messy it can be . It is these barely helpful blue prints that you hold out to light to somehow figure out what to do when your imagination and grand dreams beckon you into an invisible path ,or when you realise water ,electricity and transport bills suddenly appear to be mocking your baby steps progress towards generational wealth  or worse yet ,when your savings keep acting up as emergency funds too and by the time you sit down to calculate where you stand financially you feel like you keep reopening a new canvas .

Did you ask what an emergency fund is ? Yes? Don’t worry,  I will be covering that soon,  along other basic and vital personal finance terms . But you get the gravity of the message right? How draining it can be when you try to maintain calm on the surface  when your feet are furiously battling with water? I knew you would understand.

Since no one can quite stand courageously in their twenties and  hold claim to nonexistent experience, unless you are just plain arrogant, I think it is important to prioritise actual  learning over appearing to be finally discovering it . Truth is , it is and will be messy . Since the noise is guaranteed , turning your head to every sound that seems loudest will not only leave you with an aching neck (you get the point) but also smoky progress.

So devote yourself to actual learning on various things that you feel compelled to .Just focus on that , learning with no unnecessary deadlines and urgency . When you find what draws your attention , take delight in that and go all out.
It is one thing to get to the end and regret not surrendering yourself to the seasons of life , but if even at the very end there might be little to show for it ,at least the unbeatable knowledge you’ll be carrying with you will be a worthwhile companion .

So before we figure it out, how about carrying a thing or two along with us ?
Those that we can very much own , through dedication of time and effort.

Yours sincerely,

Gracious,

The girl next door.
