## Dear Reader

Dear reader,
I have been reading a book Titled,”Money came by the house the other day ” and I won’t lie,  for a moment after coming across the book a little giggle escaped me . Ow the title is pretty creative alright . The author  describes a hypothetical conversation with money and my oh my , isn’t the scenario just pretty personal.  Makes me look at money through a different lense , one where I relate with it as I would a dear person, with efforts of  maintaining a healthy relationship.  You know? Deliberate effort and sensible check ups ?

From the previous list on  facets of personal finance ,we will  start  off with spending , generally meaning use of resources ( time,money ,energy etc).Spending is affected by various factors such as age, personal intetests & lifestyle ,gender, income level ,culture and background .How a female or male university student spends their money isn’t necessarily the same and also absolutely not how a person who’s got a young family would. The former set is more likely to commonly prioritise things such as stationery, activities with friends and new projects while the latter will have quality food , kid’s amenities , renting a house at a conducive place at the top of their head .

Whatever point you are in life , make it a point to always ask yourself what is of more priority at that stage . This will help you not spend money on things that shouldn’t be on the list in the first place . Why is this important?

I’ll give you a moment…. okay ,yes you are pretty close .

I would simply put it this way , it saves you from grappling for air every time you have to cater for something important, with barely enough money. Know the beauty of this ? Ay ,you will love this. When counting your cost , you tell your money where to go and what to do . As you trickle down the list in order of importance and somehow everything on your list seems important , your mind will get active and begin exploring different ways you can earn that extra income .(I will cover this concept more in depth later on , you get the gist though right?) .

When things that need money to be spent on are clear before you on a list , it frees your mind to effectively plan how you’ll be spending your money.  So before you use any inflow of money you get , always ask yourself the things you need it to fund . Then yet again , arrange everything in order of importance.  Is it transport? ( for how many days ), food( in what amounts ) ? new investment( capital intensive or not ) ?  tithe ? health care needs ? A weekend out ?
Other items on the list will most certainly stare at you with hopeful eyes , and you know what you will do ?… That’s right! Get active and find a way to cater for them,  and  hear this , with much less pressure because the most vital things are already catered for ,no matter the percentage.

Whoosh
That’s quite a lot no ?
I’ll leave you to draft a list of all things that you are likely to spend money on say in one week , one month etc depending on the frequency of your cash flows.  After you are done , arrange them in order of priority then tell your money what you want it to handle first

Make sure this list is always with you and is as detailed as it possibly can be.

Remember the more disciplined you are now , the more the chances of having  great rewards draw towards you .If you already use one of these lists frequently,  way to go !! If not , we are patiently waiting to have you on board .

Okay
Talk soon.

Yours sincerely,

Gracious,

The girl next door.
