## Dear Reader

I am writing this letter in a matatu ,en route to town and as I look outside through this glass window I am reminded of the movie sarafina or all those African documentary videos I have watched. You know them? Those where we( I mean us,Africans) are shot travelling to different destinations in muddy roads wearing dejected faces that communicate deep thoughts ,,,longing . Why this relation , I don’t know. Maybe thats how my face looks to a pedestrian watching our matatu cruise by , fighting traffic. Could be because of the seemingly long day I’ve had ,coupled with constant thoughts of my need for a certain amount of money for a project I am to do. Anyway, thinking of that made me remember the basic personal finance terms I had promised to explain.

Ay , I have a lot to tell you , but first what really is personal finance ? It is managing your money around areas in relation to : income , spending, savings ,investing and protection . (Yes , you are meant to know how you are doing in all these areas ) The very daunting thought of having to keep constant tabs is why so many have a not so pleasant relationship with their finances . To be able to effectively manage your money , financial intelligence is required and that is my main aim with these articles.
.
Keeping a simple description time to time that gives you a picture of where you stand financially is important . For banks and other other businesses we call this a balance sheet . Part of the work I do everyday is ensuring the bank is able to meet its obligations when they fall due and this requires constantly ensuring our account is funded and funds distributed wisely . We call it liquidity management. Systems do help with this , and finding one broken down to suit a normal mwanachi’s personal finance management is ,well, difficult. Don’t worry through, we will create one together after I have taken you through these areas covering personal finance . You excited ? Yes ,same here . Have you ever , quite consistently , grouped your fiances in relation to these areas ,no matter how little? As they say , he who is faithful with little will be faithful with much.


You’d like to think about it ? Okay . See you in my next letter then.

Yours sincerely,

Gracious,

The girl next door.
