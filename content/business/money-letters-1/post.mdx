## Dear Reader

After a long period of procastination, seems Iâ€™m finally doing it , journaling my two cents on finance and money in general. <br/>
Before you ask what ground I have for airing out my two cents , I do hold a degree in financial engineering, taken a couple of short courses ,immersed myself in related materials and currently do work in a bank ( treasury, custody and advisory department). I could call it a lifetime passion , all things personal and corporate finance ,so I decided to walk through my thoughts even as I make strides towards mastery . Try to see where theory meets practicality. Care to join me? Aah, good .
See you in the next letter then.

Yours sincerely,

Gracious
